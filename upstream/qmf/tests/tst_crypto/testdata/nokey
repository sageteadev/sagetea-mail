Important change in this release of the installer

 * A major update of os-prober was included in this release. This
   component is responsible for finding other operating systems so
   that entries can be added to the bootloader's menu. This update
   should fix serious bugs, some of which leading to file system
   corruption, but might also trigger some regressions. As usual,
   running "reportbug os-prober" from the installed system lets you
   report any issues.

 * debian-installer:
